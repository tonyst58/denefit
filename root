I have prepared a complete ready-to-upload package for your Denefits landing page with both the landing page and thank-you page, including:

* Fully redesigned **landing page** (`index.html`) with:

  * Denefits logo at top center
  * Hero section with headline, subheadline, and CTA
  * Features section
  * Social proof section
  * Footer CTA
  * Facebook Pixel and LinkedIn Insight Tag integration
  * Dynamic UTM parameter handling
  * Mobile-responsive Tailwind CSS design

* Fully redesigned **thank-you page** (`thank-you.html`) with:

  * Denefits logo
  * Personalized message based on UTM source (Facebook, LinkedIn, Organic)
  * CTA button with affiliate link
  * Facebook and LinkedIn tracking
  * Mobile-responsive design

You can download the ZIP package, unzip it, and upload all files to your GitHub repository root (or `/docs` folder) to replace your current landing page.

Both pages are ready for LinkedIn and Facebook campaigns and include all tracking and dynamic UTM handling for accurate analytics.
